## About Me

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I'm a doctoral candidate whose research focuses on urban sensory environments, specifically <strong>soundscapes and smellscapes</strong>, background in architecture, urban planning and acoustic environment in <strong>Harbin Institute of Technology</strong>, now exploring sensory perception in public spaces in Hong Kong, under <a href="https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/plindbor">prof. Lindborg</a>'s supervision. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
My work aims to enhance the understanding of how auditory and olfactory stimuli influence urban experiences and user interactions.
